### 2. **Guess the Number Game**
A game where the computer randomly selects a number within a range, and the user has to guess it. The program gives hints if the guess is too high or too low until the user guesses the correct number.

1. Start
2. Computer generates a random number within a specified range
3. User is prompted to guess the number
4. While user's guess is not equal to the computer's number:
   a. If the guess is higher than the computer's number, display "Too high!"
   b. If the guess is lower than the computer's number, display "Too low!"
   c. Prompt the user to guess again
5. If the guess equals the computer's number, congratulate the user
6. End
```
